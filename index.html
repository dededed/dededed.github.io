			<h1><b>The Great Pyramid of Giza<b></h1>
			<h1>Date: 2/15/16</h1>
			<h3><center>While Indiana Jones was adventuring the vast desert, he stumbled upon a giant pyramid. Indiana Jones went into the pyramid to find ancient treasures. As he went in the pyramid, spikes came up from the ground. He quickly ran past the spikes and then he found himself in a large chamber. As he looked around the chamber he heard a smash. He quickly looked back and saw that a brick fell. The bricks must have weighed a lot. Suddenly, all around him bricks started to fall. He went for the nearest exit and found himself back at the start. There was a passage that he had not seen as he was running past the spikes. He started for the passage but suddenly he fell in a trapdoor. He fell into a pool of water and as he looked around he found a ladder. He swam for the ladder and then he felt the ground below him. He started to walk to the ladder until he saw something splash in the distance. He froze and looked for more splashing. He carefully made his way to the ladder until a large shark jumped at hm. He ran at full speed for the ladder. He was almost there until the shark smashed into the ladder. He leaped at the ladder to push it back in place. He was pushing with all his might when he heard splashing behind him. He jumped onto the ladder and started to climb while it was tipping. He got to the top of the ladder then he leaped onto the stone platform. He saw a chamber opening and ran for it. As he walked inside he saw something glowing in the center.
			Indiana had found his treasure. He ran for it but then suddenly remembered last time he went for his treasure. There had been traps. Maybe he could grab it and run out. He grabbed the golden goblet then he ran for the hall at the other side of the chamber. As he ran he heard a creepy noise. He continued to run and then looked back and saw the floor lowering behind him. The he felt himself start to lower and the hallway was going to be out of reach soon. As he jumped at the ledge some rocks fell down on him. They were small pebbles from the wedge. Maybe he can lower the ledge and escape. He threw the statue up and started to punch the wall. Then he jumped up and pulled himself up. The grabbed the statue and ran for the exit. He jumped outside right as the ceiling of the pyramid fell. He had got his treasure and now could tell the whole world about it.</center></h3>
